                    In my opinion Ho Chi Min cities flavors hit me just right. Their way of cooking food greatly differs compared tor Hanoi in the north. I feel like food here is a bit more western feeling where there is more frying and batters. Also with the fish sauce(The country's go to sauce) being more on the sweet side compared to Hanoi having it more on the salty side. Street food is also more plentlful because of the massive increase of nightlife compared to the rest of the country.

It tells tourists about the strong will of Vietnamese people and soldiers when competing with the giant US in nearly 20 years.In 1948 during the war against the French, Viet Minh soldiers built the tunnels to help them evade French soldiers near the area and have the ability to communicate with the villagers.

In the Vietnam War, this was extended over approximately 250 km and considered as an important base for Viet Cong to win American soldiers.
