                    Phú Quốc is a Vietnamese island off the coast of Cambodia in the Gulf of Thailand. It's known for white-sand beaches and resorts, most of which are along the palm-lined southwest coast. More than half of the island is part of Phú Quốc National Park, which features mountains, dense tropical jungle, hiking trails and wildlife. Duong Dong is the largest town, with day and night markets selling crafts, produce and fish.(Sourced from Google)

                    If seafood is your calling then this is your heaven. There is a abundance of seafood that is super fresh and right out the water. In fact during my time there i can literly see shrimp swimming in the water while we were eating at a resturnat by the pier. There are many ways the locals can cook the sea food be it stir- fried or or deep fried in batter. But my preferred method is just a quick boil and served with a salt and pepper dipping sauce.(Black pepper farms is a major part of Phu Quoc Islands Economy)
