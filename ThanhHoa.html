            <p>
                Thanh Hoa in my opion is going to be a very up and coming second tier city. With its gerographic location being so close to Hanoi it provides a good opportunity for workers who want to ocasionally do businees in Hanoi while being based in Thanh Hoa where the cost of living is far cheaper. The city has been steadily gaining in population along with more and more modern buildings and constraction projects. I have vistited Thanh Hoa multiple times throughout the years and it definatly gives my a very up and comming feel.

            <p>
                I really couldn't distinguish anything diffrent from Thanh Hoa flavors compared to Hanoi. If I had to point something out I would say there is a little less diversity of international flavors compared to Hanoi. However there is still more then enough to choose from and pleanty of coffee shops to sit and and people watch and enjoy your coffee.

                Thanh Hoa has been trying to become the local mini vacation spot for the people in the area. During recent years they have invested into taking advantave of Vietnams beautiful coastlines by building vacation resorts on the city's edge and I would have to say it is quite relaxing and afforadable. The area is called Sam Son and it is roughly a 30min drive from the city center. Speaking of the city center it is usually quite during the weekdays however it really comes alive during the weekends and there are plently of lights and street food to keep you entertained throughout the evening. I would also like to mention that the city is less dense so it feels a lot better walking around because you can actually feel a breeze.
